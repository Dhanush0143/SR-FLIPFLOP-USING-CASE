**SOFTWARE REQUIRED:**

Quartus prime

**THEORY**

SR Flip-Flop SR flip-flop operates with only positive clock transitions or negative clock transitions. Whereas, SR latch operates with enable signal. The circuit diagram of SR flip-flop is shown in the following figure.

This circuit has two inputs S & R and two outputs Qtt & Qtt’. The operation of SR flipflop is similar to SR Latch. But, this flip-flop affects the outputs only when positive transition of the clock signal is applied instead of active enable. The following table shows the state table of SR flip-flop.

Here, Qtt & Qt+1t+1 are present state & next state respectively. So, SR flip-flop can be used for one of these three functions such as Hold, Reset & Set based on the input conditions, when positive transition of clock signal is applied. The following table shows the characteristic table of SR flip-flop. Present Inputs Present State Next State

By using three variable K-Map, we can get the simplified expression for next state, Qt+1t+1. The three variable K-Map for next state, Qt+1t+1 is shown in the following figure.

The maximum possible groupings of adjacent ones are already shown in the figure. Therefore, the simplified expression for next state Qt+1t+1 is Q(t+1)=S+R′Q(t)Q(t+1)=S+R′Q(t)

**Procedure**
Open Quartus Prime and create a new Verilog project.

Write the Verilog module for SR Flip-Flop using the derived Boolean expression.

Create a testbench to provide clock, S, and R input values and observe the outputs.

Compile the design and run a functional simulation using ModelSim.

Observe the waveform to verify the flip-flop behavior against the truth table.

Record and document the outputs.

**PROGRAM**

```
module exp6(S,R,clk,Q,Qbar);
input S,R,clk;
output reg Q;
output reg Qbar;
initial Q=0;
initial Qbar=1;
always @(posedge clk)
begin
Q=S|((~R)&Q);
Qbar=~Q;
end
endmodule
```
